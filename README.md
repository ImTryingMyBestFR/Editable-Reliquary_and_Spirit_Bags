# Editable-Reliquary_and_Spirit_Bags

With this script pack, modpack makers will be able to edit reliquaries and spirit bags from roots 3. This is a temporary fix until a new version of roots comes out with this functionality integrated into root's crafttweaker methods.

The pack is comprised of 3 parts:

  1.The Definition script containing the core item functionality. This is where the loot table is. The script inside has instructions on how to edit the loot table
  
  2.The Function script containing the runic sheer racipe as well as the tooltip the item would normaly have.

  3.The assets for the reliquary and the spirit bag. The textures for this items where NOT done by me but by the Mystic Modding team.

I have also included a json file for whoever wants to add the reliquary as a trade using VTT. Information about VTT can be found 
here: https://github.com/crazysnailboy/VillagerTrades/wiki/Adding-Professions
and the mod can be downloaded here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villager-trade-tables-emerald-edition

This script pack requires both crafttweaker and contenttweaker to function
